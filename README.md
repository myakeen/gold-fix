# GoldFix: Rust FIX Protocol Engine

A high-performance Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol engine implementation in Rust, featuring robust error handling, atomic message operations, SSL/TLS support, and comprehensive session management.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

The engine is built on a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
